## Building From Source

### Requirements
- Qt version 5.7 or greater is recommended *(earlier versions might work but aren't tested)*
- A C++ compiler with support for C++11 or later (choose a compiler for your OS when installing the Qt SDK, G++ or Clang recommended)
- Qt Creator (also comes with the Qt SDK, latest version recommended)

### Build steps
Stable (usually old releases are available by default), for up to date code, checkout the [`dev` branch](https://github.com/jahshaka/VR/tree/dev) instead of `master`

- Clone the repo from the project page or download a zipped copy of the source for a specific version from the Releases tab
- Open the `.pro` file in Qt Creator
- Run the solution
