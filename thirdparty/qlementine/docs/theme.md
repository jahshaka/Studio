# Theme

## Introduction

Qlementine supports a theming system. This theming system is **basic compared to CSS**, but please keep in mind that this is specifically made **on purpose**. The goal of Qlementine is not to be a fully customizable theming system, but instead an **opinionated** look n'feel for your Qt application.

## Theme specs

Qlementine themes are JSON files.

- Every key is **optional**. If a key-value pair is absent, the theme will use its default value.
- The key names are mostly based on the `Theme` struct members, defined in `Theme.hpp`.
- Values must be either `string`, `integer` or `double`.
- Colors are defined as `string` with their **hexadecimal RGB or RGBA representation**, beginning by a `#`, following this syntax `#rrggbb` or `#rrggbbaa` (Example: `"#ff000077"` for semi-transparent red). They will be parsed and turned into `QColor`.
- Key-Value pairs are defined at the root of the JSON object file, except for the metadata.

Not all the `Theme` struct members are customizable, because some are used as cache to avoid computing the same colors again and again (e.g. the colors with the _-Transparent_ suffix) during animations.

!!! info

    info: A theme editor widget, named `ThemeEditor` is available in Qlementine, `/tools` folder.

## Keys

### Metadata

Metadata must be a JSON object for the key `meta`.

!!! info

    It is mandatory if you want to use `ThemeManager`, because the theme name is used as the identifier that should be unique for every theme.

Example:

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "author": "John Doe",
    "name": "My Awesome Theme",
    "version": "1.2.3"
  }
}
```

| Key       |  Type  | Role                                                 |
| :-------- | :----: | :--------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`    | string | Name of the theme.</br>Example: `"My Awesome Theme"` |
| `version` | string | Version of the theme.</br>Example: `"1.2.3"`         |
| `author`  | string | Author of the theme.</br>Example: `"John Doe"`       |

### Colors

Example:

```json
{
  "backgroundColorMain1": "#ffffff"
}
```
